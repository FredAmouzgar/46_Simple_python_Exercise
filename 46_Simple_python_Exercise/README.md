# 46 Simple Python Exercises

This is a repository of 46 introductory questions in Python. I hope you find it helpful.

## Description
Here is my solutions to the '46 Simple Python Exercises', initially proposed by [Torbjörn Lager](torbjorn.lager@ling.gu.se).

It has multiple mini-projects as an introduction to Python programming with a focus on strings and it covers operators, loops, files, strings, regular expressions. These practices are suitable for everyone who is interested in Python programming especially for people who are already familiar with another programming language and want to kickstart their Python programming skills.

Questions are divided into 4 sections:

- Very Simple Exercises
- Higher Order Functions and List Comprehension
- Simple exercises including Input and Output
- Somewhat harder exercises

You can start wherever you think suits your needs.
